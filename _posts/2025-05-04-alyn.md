This proposal studies the deployment of “smart cities”/“smart villages” in the Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Caucasus as a tactic of occupation by the Azerbaijani government. The project comprises maps of the region showing shifting border lines, satellite visualisation of new constructions, and a text analysing the role of smart cities in Azerbaijani nation-building. The aim of this project is to provide information on a criminally underreported conflict, while establishing a technical foundation for continued visual and textual representations for informal reporting on an ongoing conflict.  

Although several developments throughout Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh have earned the designation of "Smart City," each site's claim to this title remains quite distinct from the others. A brief examination of the technologies deployed at six of these sites, and some of their accompanying social media celebrations, in fact reveals various threads of anxiety at the heart of contemporary nation-building.

Agali I, II, and III, are a collection of settlements in the Zengilan region and perhaps the most emblematic of the historical entanglements of all of the smart cities of the former Artsakh area,  

The city's impressive post-2020 construction with integrated "smart technologies" presents an interesting paradox for Azerbaijani state mythmaking. On one hand, the city is "new," built from the ground-up with 21st-century technologies, and yet, on the other hand, it must appear "old," so as to warrant its "liberation" from ethnic Armenians in the project of "the Great Return".  

President Aliyev's tweet announcing the city's "recapture" already hints at a certain awkardness, identifying Agali I, Agali II, and Agali III as "liberated" towns:  
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="tr" dir="ltr">Müzəffər Azərbaycan Ordusu Zəngilanın Birinci Ağalı, İkinci Ağalı, Üçüncü Ağalı, Zərnəli, Füzulinin Mandılı, Cəbrayılın Qazanzəmi, Xanağabulaq, Çüllü, Quşçular, Qaraağac,</p>&mdash; İlham Əliyev (@azpresident) <a href="https://twitter.com/azpresident/status/1321429548538449920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In truth, like many other caucasian cities, Agali's history comprises a palimsest of names and residents better read in reverse chronological order. Just prior to the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, the city, then called "Aghadzor," was home to a majority population of ethnic Armenians. Even as of 2025, videos of Aghadzor street signs or restaurants can be found online. Further back, during the establishment of the Republic of Artsakh and the fall of the Soviet Union, a 1992 CIA linguistic study identified the area as populated, but with no dominant linguistic group, likely a mix between Azeri Turkish and Armenian. Then, going back to 1962, Soviet administrative maps show the area belonging to the general administrative region of Zengilan in the Azerbaijan SSR.  

As of writing, no evidence is known to the authors of this site of the name "Agali" prior to the Soviet Union, though its pre-Soviet historical name "Alirzah" does imply a Persian or Turkic-language-speaking population. The ambiguity of this city's origin does not accept the facile ethnonationalist identification of the city, but rather demonstrates the city as something that predates the very invention of nationhood. Ironically, it is precisely the possibility of this city having potentially Turkic origins as Alirzah that makes its renaming as Agali so necessary for Azerbaijan. This is because, counterintuitively, if the linguistic history of the city is to be accepted, then it must be furthermore accepted that supposed linguistic borders do not follow the ethnonationalist borders presently claimed by the Azerbaijani state. Agali, therefore, can only ever be seen as "old enough," but not an ancient metropolis like Baku or Fuzuli.  

This perhaps places greater emphasis on the role of the "smart technologies". Indeed, Aliyev's tweet about Agali I, II, and III is perhaps less about a truly historical claim and more about the World Bank's smart city report published earlier in 2020. One must note, however, that with the exception of the "smart street lights", the technologies that make Agali "smart" are in fact quite ubiquitous among other cities across Azerbaijan. Most technologies, including the notable video-based government services, are managed through Əmək pensiyası və sosial müavinətlər (DOST), a state agency for social welfare. Agali is, at its core, a housing project, part of the program of "repatriating" 100,000 Azerbaijani citizens at the cost, no less, of 130,000 displaced ethnic Armenians.  

The smart street lights, meanwhile, suggest a different set of priorities in designating the city as a "smart city". Visible in the video below, the lamps bear substantial resemblance to <a href="https://bbs.huaweicloud.com/blogs/394072">Huawei Smart Poles</a>. While further investigation is needed to confirm the sourcing of these lamps, "smart city technologies" have elsewhere proven instrumental in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-7512-9_21developing"> China-Azerbaijan relations</a>.

The instrumentality of Agali's "smart city-ness" thus reveals three anxieties. From a historical point of view, the designation smart city provides a means of subverting question that may undermine some of the more tenuous historical claims to an ancient Azerbaijani nation state. Second, the city's "intelligence" offers something of a techno-propagandistic surplus that avoids the uncomfortable conclusion that the city's role in housing people necessarily starts with a deficit of houses. Third, the city's specific technologies provide economic opportunities, not only to request loans from the World Bank, but to improve trade relations with foreign partners such as China and Israel.
